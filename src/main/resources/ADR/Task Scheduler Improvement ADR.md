### ADR 1: Improvements to the Task Scheduler
#### Status
Accepted

#####Context
The current task scheduler requires enhancements to support task prioritization, throughput measurement, fixed-delay scheduling, and graceful shutdown. A need for unique task identification has also been identified, along with the necessity for comprehensive test coverage.

#### Decision
We will improve the task scheduler by:

* Implementing task execution within the scheduler loop.
* Adding support for scheduled tasks with fixed delays or rates.
* Integrating throughput measurement to monitor performance.
* Ensuring the priority queue respects task priorities.
* Establishing a unique task ID system and a method to register/retrieve tasks.
* Creating a graceful shutdown process.
* Writing extensive test cases to ensure functionality.

#### Consequences
* These improvements will make the task scheduler more robust, feature-complete, and easier to monitor. 
It will allow for priority-based task management, more accurate performance assessment,
and safer operation during the application shutdown. 
* The unique task identification system will facilitate better task management, 
and the written test cases will guarantee that the scheduler functions as intended.
